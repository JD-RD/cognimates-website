  guide:
    - step: >
        Step 1: We will start with just a stationary thinking emoji.<br>

    - step: >
        Step 2: To make this more interesting, we can use a block from Twitter to get the last tweet from someone. Then use a block from the Feelings extension to check on the mood of the Tweet. <br>

    - step: >
        Step 3: Now that we can get the mood of the tweet, we can change the costume of the emoji to make it happy or sad, make the emoji move up or down for the mood. We can also move the emoji to show the mood.<br>

    - step: >
        Step 4: Finally, you can add in some blocks from the music extension to play some happy, sad, or neutral notes depending on the mood we received from the tweet. <br>
